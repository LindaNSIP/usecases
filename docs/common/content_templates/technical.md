## Technical implementation 


### Before you start 

-   Are you using the SIF Common Framework? It's a supported open source
    offering which can vastly simplify your SIF 3 development effort.\
    Try out the open source
    [Java](https://github.com/nsip/sif3-framework-java) or
    [.NET](https://github.com/nsip/sif3-framework-dotnet) framework. You
    may also find helpful this guide to using the framework with HITS.

-   Apply for a HITS testing account at <info@nsip.edu.au>. This will
    give you access to your own testing environment, which provides all necessary authentication and access tokens to
    work with the HITS API.
