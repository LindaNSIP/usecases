## What you need before you start: 

To use the Hub Testing Integration System (HITS), you'll need the following:

-   A HITS testing account  - apply at <info@nsip.edu.au>
-   This will give you access to your own testing environmentÂ 
-   Your testing environment will provide you with all necessary
    authentication and access tokens to work with the HITS API.

You'll also need a basic knowledge of SIF REST:

-   Here is [some information from the SIF
    Association](https://www.sifassociation.org/Resources/Developer-Resources/SIF-3-0/Pages/SIF-3.0-Infrastructure.aspx).
-   Here is [a short (1-day) course in developing with SIF 3
    REST](http://kb.nsip.edu.au/display/SATWI/SIF+3+Bootcamp+online).

You need to know [how to work with a usecase in HITS and access the HITS API](working_use_case_hits.md)
