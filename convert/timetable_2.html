							<p>The ScheduledActivity object is designed for student activities that do not involve classroom instruction, and/or that are not recurring; e.g. excursions.

			<h6 id="Timetablehow-toHITS-Inbrief">In brief:</h6>
			<ul>
				<li>Allow schools secure access to SIS information</li>
				<li>Allow schools to use the Timetabling product of their choice</li>
				<li>Allow&nbsp;3rd&nbsp;Party Timetabling apps automated access to base information</li>
				<li>Allow&nbsp;3rd&nbsp;Party Timetabling apps to publish a school&#39;s schedule to a jurisdictional hub.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Schools currently use third-party timetabling applications locally to supplement their Student Information System (SIS). The seed information for generating timetables is held in the School&#39;s SIS and usually exported locally with little security.&nbsp;<br class="atl-forced-newline" />
				<br class="atl-forced-newline" />
				As jurisdictions centralise systems,&nbsp;3rd&nbsp;Party Vendors&nbsp;have the opportunity to seed their product/s from a quality assured data hub using automated feeds, rather than manual updates from the school.&nbsp;3rd&nbsp;Party Vendors are also expected to provide information directly back to the centralised system through an automated feed, rather than having the information mediated through the school.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>This use case shows how&nbsp;3rd&nbsp;party attendance vendors can connect to a centralised data hub to securely access to the required information and publish back the Timetable records to the centralised data hub.</p>

				<li><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">All SIF objects posted by the Timetabling App must have referential integrity.
