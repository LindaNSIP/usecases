				</ul>
				<p>There are two possible ways to obtain the Base information through REST service path calls.</p>
				<p>A. The first assumes that all available students, staff, and classes, in all known schools, will be exposed to the third party application, as a single dump of data. This is the path recommended for HITS assurance, as it is simpler to fetch the data and start generating objects for validation.&nbsp; (This is useful to prove that the objects can be consumed and processed, as HITS end points contain customised test data.)</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Get SchoolInfos: <span data-mce-style="color: #0000ff;" style="color: rgb(0,0,255);"><a>http://.../SchoolInfos</a></span></li>

					<li>Get TeachingGroups: <a>http://.../TeachingGroups</a>&nbsp;(linked to a school via SchoolInfoRefId)</li>
				</ol>
				<div><span>B. The second assumes, more realistically, that only certain teaching groups will be exposed to the application, and that any staff and student records exposed should be accessed via their teaching group. You do not need to obtain data this way for HITS assurance: you will end up getting the same data, since at this stage endpoints are customised for the user. But you should be prepared to consume data from SIF APIs in the following&nbsp;way for production environment where the end point contains more than one school&#39;s data:</span></div>

<h4 id="businessdriver">Business driver - what problem is this usecase is trying to solve?</h4>
<h6>In brief:</h6>
<ul>
	<li>Allow schools secure access to SIS information</li>
	<li>Allow schools to use the classroom assessment product of their choice</li>
	<li>Allow&nbsp;3rd&nbsp;Party <span>classroom assessment</span>&nbsp;apps automated access to base information, including class membership</li>
	<li>Allow&nbsp;3rd&nbsp;Party <span>classroom assessment</span>&nbsp;apps to publish assessment results records to a jurisdictional hub.</li>
</ul>
<p>Schools currently use third-party <span>classroom assessment</span>&nbsp;locally for formative assessment. The seed information for generating accounts on third party <span>applications</span>&nbsp;is held in the School&#39;s <span>Student Information System (SIS),</span>&nbsp;and is usually exported locally to the third party applications with little security. An added complication is that not only student data needs to be provided as seed information, but also class membership data, since classroom assessment is typically assigned to a class cohort by the class teacher; class memberships can change frequently, and impose an additional burden on teachers manually updating the third-party tools.<br class="atl-forced-newline" />
	<br class="atl-forced-newline" />
	As jurisdictions centralise systems,&nbsp;3rd&nbsp;Party Vendors&nbsp;have the opportunity to seed their product/s from a quality assured data hub using automated feeds, rather than manual updates from the school. This allows changes such as new enrolments and changes in class membership to be reflected promptly and accurately in the third party applications. 3rd&nbsp;Party Vendors are also expected to provide information directly back to the centralised system through an automated feed, rather than having the information mediated through the school. This enables not only more secure and efficient transfer of information, but also the possibility of extracting business intelligence across the assessment results of multiple schools stored in the same hub.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This use case shows how&nbsp;3rd&nbsp;party&nbsp;classroom assessment&nbsp;vendors can connect to a centralised data hub to securely access to the required information and publish back the assessment result records to the centralised data hub.</p>
