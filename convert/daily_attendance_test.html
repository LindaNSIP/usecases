<p>The ScheduledActivity object is designed for student activities that do not involve classroom instruction, and/or that are not recurring; e.g. excursions.

<h1 id="Timetablehow-toHITS-Moreinformation">More information</h1>
<h4 id="businessdriver">What is the business problem this usecase is trying to solve?</h4>
<h6 id="Timetablehow-toHITS-Inbrief">In brief:</h6>
<ul>
<li>Allow schools secure access to SIS information</li>
<li>Allow schools to use the Timetabling product of their choice</li>
<li>Allow 3rd Party Timetabling apps automated access to base information</li>
<li>Allow 3rd Party Timetabling apps to publish a school's schedule to a jurisdictional hub.</li>
</ul>
<p>Schools currently use third-party timetabling applications locally to supplement their Student Information System (SIS). The seed information for generating timetables is held in the School's SIS and usually exported locally with little security. <br />
<br />
As jurisdictions centralise systems, 3rd Party Vendors have the opportunity to seed their product/s from a quality assured data hub using automated feeds, rather than manual updates from the school. 3rd Party Vendors are also expected to provide information directly back to the centralised system through an automated feed, rather than having the information mediated through the school. </p>
<p>This use case shows how 3rd party attendance vendors can connect to a centralised data hub to securely access to the required information and publish back the Timetable records to the centralised data hub.</p>
<h4 id="usecasepreconditions">Usecase preconditions (assurance)</h4>

<li><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">All SIF objects posted by the Timetabling App must have referential integrity. Any RefId contained in the SIF object must refer either to a SIF object provisioned to the App—e.g. SchoolInfo, StudentPersonal, RoomInfo, TimeTableSubject), or to SIF object that has also been posted by the App to the Zone (e.g. TimeTableCell referring to TimeTable).This condition applies recursively to all additional SIF objects posted by the App. The test of this condition is done only when the App indicates that it has finished publishing to the Zone the objects required for the test.</span></li>
