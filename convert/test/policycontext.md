#### Introduction
#### Purpose: intended business outcomes

At an individual level, at school level: To track the extent to which students are meeting their obligation to attend school, and to signal the need for intervention where this is not the case.

At an aggregate level, at school system and national level: To flag to education providers and government the schools and areas where attendance expectations are not being met, and to signal the need for larger scale intervention in those areas.

Context: business motivation   

Schools are required to meet their duty of care obligation to students, by ensuring that they are attending school unless there are compelling reasons for them not to.
Failure of students to attend school without justification is a major indicator of students being at risk of not completing their education. Government departments have a responsibility to detect such risk and intervene as appropriate, both at an individual level, and at an aggregate level (targeting schools or socioeconomic groups). 
Tracking Attendance is used for a variety of operational, accountability and strategic purposes, and for educational research.
Authorising environment-Legislation, agreement etc

Education providers in each state and jurisdiction are required by law to determine the whereabouts of each student on each school day. There is also a legal obligation on guardians to ensure that students under their care attend school.

The National Education Agreement of COAG identifies student attendance rates as a key measure of engagement, and as a performance indicator in the National Education Reform Agreement (NERA), the National Indigenous Reform Agreement (NIRA), the Report on Government Services (ROGS) and the Measurement Framework for Schooling in Australia. 

Compliance with federal reporting requirements is a precondition for ongoing funding support to schools from the government.
Governance, oversight: business accountability 

National standards for attendance are prepared by the Student Attendance Data subgroup of ACARA, with representation from all jurisdictions and sectors.
