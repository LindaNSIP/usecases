			</td>
			<td class="confluenceTd">
				<p><span>NAPLAN testing is to occur this year, through a national delivery system. Around NAPLAN census time, the SIS lodges bulk information about its NAPLAN candidates to the Assessment Platform (AP), on behalf of one or more schools.&nbsp; Any other information, including registration of students to particular NAPLAN testing events, personal needs and preferences, and assigning staff members and invigilators, is done out of band on the AP web site.</span></p>
				<h4>Assumptions:</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>SIS can both read and write SIF records.</li>
					<li>SIS manages information for an individual school, a systemic authority data hub, or a third party data hub.</li>
					<li><span>Quality assurance may be deferred to after records are uploaded, through record editing permitted by the AP.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></li>
					<li><span>Contact details of the school or school system administrator for&nbsp;NAPLAN Online are known to the AP.</span></li>
					<li><span>S<span>chool (or school system) administrator</span> has access to the&nbsp;AP as a registered and authorised user, so that they can authorise SIS access, confirm the upload data, and authorise other staff on the&nbsp;AP.</span></li>
					<li>Allocation of staff accounts for teachers in schools&nbsp;is&nbsp;done outside of this process. It can be based on the staff records uploaded to the AP, but it can also be set up before any staff records are uploaded.</li>
					<li>The school(s)&#39; ACARA ID is known to the SIS. The mechanism for this is out of scope for this use case: school systems are expected to arrange a computer feed to the Australian School List, while non-systemic schools will likely query a web interface.</li>
					<li><span data-mce-style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 13.0pt;" style="font-size: 10.0pt;line-height: 13.0pt;">Personal Needs and Preferences are manually entered into the AP, and are not contributed using this method.</span></li>
					<li>Allocation of students to a particular session of NAP is&nbsp;done through the&nbsp;AP.</li>
					<li><span>Allocation of students to a particular NAP activity is done&nbsp;through the&nbsp;AP.</span></li>
					<li>
						<p data-mce-style="margin-left: 0.0px;" style="margin-left: 0.0px;">AP&nbsp;is tenanted: the SIS client does not have access to data outside its school/school system.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p data-mce-style="margin-left: 0.0px;" style="margin-left: 0.0px;">AP is purged of data at the end of each assessment cycle: only current student records are available from it.&nbsp;</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p data-mce-style="margin-left: 0.0px;" style="margin-left: 0.0px;"><span style="font-size: 0.923em;">StudentPersonal/MostRecent includes all information necessary for student registration in NAPLAN, without needing to resort to StudentSchoolEnrollment.</span></p>
					</li>
					<li><span style="font-size: 0.923em;">StudentPersonal records</span><span style="font-size: 0.923em;"> are only assigned to one school for the purposes of NAPLAN. If they need to be assigned to more than one school within a system, multiple StudentPersonal records need to be created for the same student. Note that the Assessment Platform will create a separate record for each student enrolment, which corresponds to the first alternative.</span></li>

<h4 id="businessdriver">Business driver - what is the problem is this usecase is trying to solve?</h4>
<h6>In brief:</h6>
<ul>
	<li>Allow schools to provision StudentPersonal records to the Assessment Platform (as potential candidates for NAP)</li>
	<li>Enable those schools to retrieve the Platform Student Identifier that the Assessment Platform associates with StudentPersonal records<br />
		&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p data-mce-style="margin-left: 6.0px;" style="margin-left: 6.0px;">The SIS is presumed to have limited technical capabilities. In particular, there is no requirement for it to read SIF objects from external sources (such as the&nbsp;Australian School List), although schools are presumed to be able to supply their own ACARA Id. The SIS is not required to be able to relate objects to each other (e.g. through StudentSchoolEnrollment). The use case is applicable to both individual school and to school systems; in the case of school systems, the SIS is expected to have system-wide scope.&nbsp;</p>
<p data-mce-style="margin-left: 6.0px;" style="margin-left: 6.0px;">This use case is quite restricted, and does not support extending SIS capability to other areas (such as online assessment or census). It requires&nbsp;the AP to do school-specific processing for each SIS client. It is not currently clear whether this use case provides enough information to support NAPLAN reporting back to the school.&nbsp;</p>
<p data-mce-style="margin-left: 6.0px;" style="margin-left: 6.0px;">This usecase deviates from the usual workflow of HITS: the SIS being tested provides data before it consumes it and processes it.</p>
