<p>Vendor-facing (pull); HITS represents the Jurisdiction and is the data source for seed information.</p>
<p>Consume: - on the Jurisdiction-established Zone for the app, third party app accesses the SchoolInfo object corresponding to their school. - Third party app ingests the relevant SIF Objects.</p>
<p>Get SchoolInfos: http://.../SchoolInfos - This step may be skipped if the Third party app if the SchoolInfo RefId is already known. - The query mechanism is specific to the hub, but retrieval is unlikely to be automatic; it is likeliest for the school to do a manual query on the school name, using one of the established SIF query mechanisms, or else retrieve all SchoolInfo records from the hub and choose the the right record.</p>

<p>In brief, this process:</p>
<ul>
<li>Allows schools secure access to SIS information.</li>
<li>Allows schools to use the SIS product of their choice.</li>
<li>Allows third party SIS apps to publish a school's student enrollments to a jurisdictional hub.</li>
</ul>
<p>The use case described here satisfies the following scenarios in the SIS Baseline Profile (SBP): </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>3.1.2 Future Enrollment:</strong> StudentSchoolEnrollment/TimeFrame is set to F (future)</li>
<li><strong>3.1.4 New Current Enrollment:</strong> StudentSchoolEnrollment/TimeFrame is set to C (current)</li>
<li><strong>3.3.4.1 New Student Contact and Relationship</strong></li>
<li><strong>3.3.4.2 New Relationship added to a Current Contact</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The use case described above can be straightforwardly extended with update operations to satisfy the following scenarios in the SBP:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>3.1.3 Future to Current Enrollment:</strong> StudentSchoolEnrollment/TimeFrame is updated from F (future) to C (current)</li>
<li><strong>3.1.5 Year End Rollover:</strong> StudentSchoolEnrollment/TimeFrame is updated from C (current) to H (historical); new StudentSchoolEnrollment is created with StudentSchoolEnrollment/TimeFrame set to C (current)</li>
<li><strong>3.1.6 Exit School:</strong> StudentSchoolEnrollment/TimeFrame is updated from C (current) to H (historical)</li>
<li><strong>3.1.7 Change Campus:</strong> StudentSchoolEnrollment/TimeFrame is updated from C (current) to H (historical), with RecordClosureReason set to CampusExit and ExitType set to &quot;Transfer campus of the same school&quot;; new StudentSchoolEnrollment is created with StudentSchoolEnrollment/TimeFrame set to C (current) and EntryType set to &quot;Transfer from a different campus of the same school&quot;</li>
<li><strong>3.1.8 Mid-year Promotion/Demotion:</strong> StudentSchoolEnrollment/YearLevel and StudentSchoolEnrollment/PromotionInfo/PromotionStatus is updated; StudentPersonal/YearLevel is updated</li>
<li><strong>3.1.9 Change in Personal Details:</strong> update StudentPersonal</li>
<li><strong>3.3.4.3 Change to a StudentContact Personal information:</strong> update StudentContactPersonal</li>
<li><strong>3.3.4.4 Change to StudentContact Relationship info:</strong> update StudentContactRelationship</li>
<li><strong>3.3.4.5 Remove a StudentContact from a student:</strong> delete StudentContactRelationship record</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="usecase-preconditions-for-assurance">Usecase preconditions for assurance</h4>
<p>As this use case applies to school systems, the enrollment records needs to identify the school being enrolled into. This is done with the established SIF mechanism of referencing a SchoolInfo RefId. The master for the SchoolInfo object is the jurisdiction hub, and the third party SIS is meant to retrieve the relevant SchoolInfo object from the hub, in order to reference it correctly.</p>
<p>The following conditions also must be met:</p>
<ul>
<li>Any SIF object published by the App must be valid against the SIF AU 1.3 schema</li>
<li>Any SIF object published by the App should confirm to the SBP profile of the SIF-AU schema specific to the given scenarios (including both the black elements, and the blue elements intended for national reporting). In particular:
<ul>
<li>The use of several elements is upgraded from optional to strongly recommended</li>
<li>FamilyName, GivenName, MiddleName are used instead of FullName for students, and are strongly recommended for student contacts</li>
<li>StudentPersonal/PersonInfo/Demographics/Sex is mandatory</li>
<li>StudentPersonal/PersonInfo/Demographics/BirthDate is mandatory</li>
<li>StudentSchoolEnrollment/YearLevel is mandatory</li>
</ul></li>
<li>All SIF objects posted by the App must have referential integrity. Any RefId contained in the SIF object must refer either to a SIF object provisioned to the App — for example SchoolInfo, or to a SIF object that has also been posted by the App to the Zone (e.g. StudentSchoolEnrollment referring to StudentPersonal, StudentContactRelationship referring to StudentContactPersonal).This condition applies recursively to all additional SIF objects posted by the App. The test of this condition is done only when the App indicates that it has finished publishing to the Zone the objects required for the test.</li>
