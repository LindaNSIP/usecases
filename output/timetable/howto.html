<p>The SIF/XML data sent by the third party app to the jurisdiction zone for the app must be able to respond to requests for all the following records within a school:</p>
<ul>
<li>TimeTable</li>
<li>TimeTableCell</li>
<li>TeachingGroup</li>

<p>The SchoolCourseInfo object is only required if the Timetabling application will record the link between the School Course offering (as distinct from the Timetable Subject) and the Teaching Group. This link is optional, and application developers should check with the School Authority on whether they need to provide it.</p>
<p>The ScheduledActivity object is designed for student activities that do not involve classroom instruction, and/or that are not recurring; e.g. excursions. They do not need to be implemented by a TimeTablingApplication (and in fact they relate to scheduling rather than timetabling); application developers should check with the school authority on whether they need to provide it.</p>

<p>In brief:</p>
<ul>
<li>Allows schools secure access to SIS information.</li>
<li>Allows schools to use the Timetabling product of their choice.</li>
<li>Allows third party timetabling apps automated access to base information.</li>
<li>Allows third party timetabling apps to publish a school's schedule to a jurisdictional hub.</li>
</ul>
<p>Schools currently use third-party timetabling apps locally to supplement their Student Information System (SIS). The seed information for generating timetables is held in the School's SIS and usually exported locally with little security. </p>
<p>As jurisdictions centralise systems, third party vendors have the opportunity to seed their product/s from a quality assured data hub using automated feeds, rather than manual updates from the school. Third party vendors are also expected to provide information directly back to the centralised system through an automated feed, rather than having the information mediated through the school. </p>
<p>This use case shows how third party vendors can connect to a centralised data hub to securely access to the required information and publish back the timetable records to the centralised data hub.</p>
<h4 id="usecase-preconditions-for-assurance"><a href="#usecase-preconditions-for-assurance">Usecase preconditions for assurance</a></h4>
<p>The following conditions also must be met:</p>
<ul>
<li>Any SIF object published by the timetabling app must be valid against the SIF-AU 1.3 schema.</li>
<li>All SIF objects posted by the timetabling app must have referential integrity. Any RefId contained in the SIF object must refer either to a SIF object provisioned to the App (e.g. SchoolInfo, StudentPersonal, RoomInfo, TimeTableSubject) or to a SIF object that has also been posted by the app to the zone (e.g. TimeTableCell referring to TimeTable). This condition applies recursively to all additional SIF objects posted by the app. The test of this condition is done only when the app indicates that it has finished publishing to the zone the objects required for the test.</li>
</ul>
<p>For the purposes of validation, a new TeachingGroup object is well-formed if:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>All mandatory elements of the TeachingGroup object are provided.</li>
<li>The TeachingGroup contains a TeachingGroupPeriodList.</li>
<li>The TeachingGroupPeriodList references either TimeTableCellRefId, or a combination of RoomNumber, DayId, and either PeriodId or StartTime</li>
<li>The TeachingGroup must contain a StudentList. The Students referenced in the StudentList must have StudentPersonal RefIds and Names corresponding to those supplied in provisioning.</li>
<li>The TeachingGroup must contain a TeacherList. The Teachers referenced in the TeacherList must have StaffPersonal RefIds and Names corresponding to those supplied in provisioning.</li>
<li>The TeachingGroup must reference a SchoolInfo RefId. </li>
</ol>
<p>For the purposes of validation, a new TimeTableCell object is well-formed if it satisfies the following requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>All mandatory elements of the TimeTableCell object are provided  </li>
<li>For the purposes of validation, an update to a TeachingGroup object can be a partially populated object, containing only the updated values, rather than a complete object.</li>
<li>If an update to TeachingGroup involves any element being added, changed, or deleted in TeacherList, StudentList, or TeachingGroupPeriodList, then the entire list affected must be included in the object representation in the update request.</li>
