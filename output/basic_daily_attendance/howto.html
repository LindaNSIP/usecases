<li>on the Jurisdiction-established Zone for the App, Third party app accesses all CalendarSummary objects linked to the given School RefId, and all CalendarDate objects linked to the given CalendarSummary objects.

<p>In brief:</p>
<ul>
<li>Allow schools secure access to SIS information</li>
<li>Allow schools to use the Attendance product of their choice</li>
<li>Allow 3rd  Party Daily Attendance apps automated access to base information</li>
<li>Allow 3rd  Party Daily Attendance apps to publish school attendance records to a jurisdictional hub.</li>
</ul>
<p>Schools currently use third-party attendance applications locally to supplement their Student Information System (SIS). The seed information for recording of attendance is held in the School's SIS and usually exported locally with little security.</p>
<p>As jurisdictions centralise systems, 3rd Party Vendors have the opportunity to seed their product/s from a quality assured data hub using automated feeds, rather than manual updates from the school. 3rd  Party Vendors are also expected to provide information directly back to the centralised system through an automated feed, rather than having the information mediated through the school. </p>
<p>This use case shows how 3rd  party attendance vendors can connect to a centralised data hub to securely access to the required information and publish back the Daily Attendance records to the centralised data hub.</p>
<h4 id="usecase-preconditions-for-assurance"><a href="#usecase-preconditions-for-assurance">Usecase preconditions for assurance</a></h4>
<p>The following conditions also must be met:</p>
<p>  Must be able to post to the Zone an update to a well-formed StudentDailyAttendance object, as defined below.</p>
<ul>
<li>Any SIF object published by the App must be valid against the SIF-AU 1.3 schema</li>
<li>All SIF objects posted by the Attendance App must have referential integrity. Any RefId contained in the SIF object must refer to a SIF object provisioned to the App—e.g. SchoolInfo, StudentPersonal, CalendarDate).This condition applies recursively to all additional SIF objects posted by the App. The test of this condition is done only when the App indicates that it has finished publishing to the Zone the objects required for the test.</li>
</ul>
<p>For the purposes of validation, a new StudentDailyAttendance object is well-formed if:</p>
<ul>
<li>the provided CalendarDate object indicates that a date is not counted toward student attendance (CalendarDate/StudentAttendance/CountsTowardsAttendance), then either no StudentDailyAttendance record is generated for that date, or else the StudentDailyAttendance/AttendanceStatus value in the object is &quot;NA&quot; (not applicable)</li>
<li>all mandatory elements of the StudentDailyAttendance object are provided</li>
<li>the StudentDailyAttendance object points to a valid StudentPersonal and SchoolInfo object</li>
</ul>
<p>For the purposes of validation, a new StudentAttendanceSummary object is well-formed if it satisfies the following requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>All mandatory elements of the StudentAttendanceSummary object are provided.</li>
</ul>
<p>For the purposes of validation, a new StudentAttendanceTimeList object is well-formed if it satisfies the following requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>All mandatory elements of the StudentAttendanceTimeList object are provided.</li>
<li>The StudentAttendanceTimeList  object points to a valid StudentPersonal and SchoolInfo object.</li>
