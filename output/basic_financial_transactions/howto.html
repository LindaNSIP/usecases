<p>The SIF/XML data sent by the 3rd Party app to the Jurisdiction Zone for the app must satisfy the following conditions: - Any SIF object published by the App must be valid against the SIF-AU 1.5draft1 schema (available on request) - All mandatory elements of the submitted SIF objects are provided - All SIF objects posted by the App must have referential integrity. Any RefId contained in the SIF object must refer to a SIF object provisioned to the App—e.g. AccountingPeriod, FinancialAccount—or to another SIF object posted by the App (e.g. Payment referring to Billing).This condition applies recursively to all additional SIF objects posted by the App. The test of this condition is done only when the App indicates that it has finished publishing to the Zone the objects required for the test.</p>

<li>Third party app processes information and gathers financials Information</li>
<li>Third party application creates return financials objects specific to the School</li>
<li>The transaction information generated by the App is represented by the following financials objects:

</ul>
<p>This use case responds to the growing interest in using SIF AU to exchange financial data, and specifically to the ACT's integration project. The objects proposed for use in this use case are tentative, and will need to be further reviewed by the SIF AU Data Standards Working Group (SIF AU DSWG),  to be included in SIF AU 1.4: they are subject to change, and this use case will be the first time they are used. Anyone seeking to engage with this use case is encouraged to familiarise themselves with the proposed SIF AU financials objects, available on request from NSIP.</p>
<p>This use case assumes that SIF is required only to exchange information about individual transactions (e.g. purchase orders, invoices, receipts, journals), and that reporting will be done out of existing applications—although those reports may be based on the transactional information received through SIF. </p>
<p>This use case assumes that payroll transactions are out of scope.</p>
<p>This use case presupposes that there are processes in place for transactions to take place with external parties (debtors and creditors); it does not specify any mechanisms outside of SIF. A purchase order for example may be transmitted to a vendor as a SIF Purchasing object, or as a printed document drawing on information included in the SIF Purchasing object. The mechanisms for generating and sending such a printed document are outside the scope of this use case, and would be provided by existing financial applications. </p>
<p>The following lists the priority areas of interest to the ACT in finance (numbers in parentheses refer to the diagrams below) :</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Receipting – the ability to produce receipts for (1a) Families/ Debtors and (1b) General Ledgers.</li>
<li>Purchase Orders – the ability to (2a) produce commitments into ledgers for purchases and (2b) send these to creditors as an approval method for purchases. We also need to be able to (2c) draw down the purchase order at time of payment to enable the commitment to be used.</li>
<li>Invoices – The ability to produce invoice for Debtors, recovery of hire costs in particular.</li>
<li>At present we enter into our system invoices to get these approved before the payment is produced and sent off.</li>
<li>Payments – we need to be able to produce a file to be imported into the bank as majority of our payments are made through EFT but we need to be able to produce cheques also.</li>
<li>We need to be able to run an end of period process including (6a) a bank reconciliation and (6b) produce reports that go to the Principal, school board, provides the basis of producing the monthly BAS and gives reports to various teachers, faculty or as requested.</li>
<li>We need to be able to run end of year as schools operate on a calendar year rather than financial year.</li>
<li>We also need to be able to do (8a) journals to correct ledger errors, GST errors and (8b) need to be able to make adjustments to the schools budget, also (8c) produce the schools budget prior to presentation and approval of the budget.</li>
</ol>
<p>The following three workflows are SIF-based exchanges which realise most of the ACT priority areas:</p>
